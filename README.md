# WizardDashboard
old prototype for a dashboard for a discord bot that was being developed. currently shelved.

I haven't looked at the code for this particular project in a while,
but there should be examples of multiple types of coding
including C#, JavaScript, CSS, and ASP.Net / HTML5
in an MVC Modeled Project
